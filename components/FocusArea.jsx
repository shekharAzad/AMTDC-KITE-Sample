                <p className="font__control">
                  Sustained R&amp;D in multiple aspects (related to
                  productivity, precision and reliability) of machine tools and
                  their tooling technologies are required to achieve substantial
                  improvement that provides a competitive edge for the machine
                  tools manufactured in India, globally. Among these machine
                  tools, the development of so-called “Mother Machines'' (The
                  Japanese call them “mother machines'' because they make other
                  machines possible) is currently limited to Germany and Japan.
                  Recently countries like Korea and Taiwan, that have a strong
                  history of machine tool development, and an equally strong
                  R&amp;D mechanism with deep and long collaboration with
                  universities, are also into this development of mother machine
                  tools. The development of such machine tools in India must
                  likewise be oriented towards a collaborative mechanism which
                  brings key stakeholders such as industry, academia and
                  government to address the major technological gaps. Thus there
                  is a need for an ecosystem that fosters innovation in
                  multi-disciplinary domains to achieve this combination of
                  software, hardware, and precision manufacturing.

                  Production facilities developed and maintained by several
                  public sector enterprises are neither completely utilised nor
                  scaled up to leverage the needs of growing demands in our
                  country. There is a huge potential to leverage such facilities
                  for missions with national cause. Apart from the public sector
                  enterprises, many private sector organisations, as well as a
                  good number of SMEs, can join together in enabling the concept
                  of shared manufacturing under Smart Manufacturing
                  Technology-driven approach to cross utilise and effectively
                  plan their services to their capabilities in the production
                  process. The realization of shared manufacturing related
                  services necessitates the development of a networking
                  platform.

                  The Indian manufacturing ecosystem has predominantly been
                  dependent on the import of sophisticated technologies from
                  other developed economies, which has limited the capability of
                  the Indian manufacturing ecosystem to develop and produce
                  several industrial and consumer products alike. Most of these
                  products are either imported as a complete assembly or as
                  sub-assemblies and assembled in house. A detailed study of the
                  imported goods provides an insight into several such products.
